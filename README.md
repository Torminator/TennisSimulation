Console-Python Simulation for a Tennis Match

This project simulate a tennis match between two players on a relative fine level.
Every player has the following attributes as probabilities:
* 1st Serve
* 1st Serve Winner
* 2nd Serve
* 2nd Serve Winner
* Return 1st Serve
* Return 2nd Serve
* Return a winner after 1stServe
* Return a winner after 2nd Serve
* generally return the ball in a rally
* hit a winner in a rally

Now the simulation uses these probabilities to simulate every point of a match.
